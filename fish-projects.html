                    <h4>Kootenai River Native Fish Conservation Aquaculture Program</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Kootenai Tribe's aquaculture program began in 1989 as a small experimental hatchery for Kootenai River white sturgeon. The program has since evolved to include many aspects of native fish restoration and aquaculture. The primary purpose of the aquaculture program is to prevent exctintion of Kootenai sturgeon and reestablish a native burbot population. Upgrades to the existing Tribal Hatchery and construction of a new Twin Rivers Hatchery were completed in 2014.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Kootenai River Habitat Restoration Program</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Kootenai River Habitat Restoration Program is a large scale, ecosystem-based habitat restoration program designed to restore and maintain Kootenai River habitat conditions that support all life stages of endangered Kootenai River white sturgeon, burbot, and other native fish within a 55-mile reach of the Kootenai River in Idaho. Activities include planning, data collection and analysis, design, and phased implementation of multiple habitat restoration projects.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reconnect Kootenai River with the Historic Floodplain Project</h4>
                    <p>
                        The primary goal of the Reconnect Project is to restore floodplain habitats and functions, depressional wetlands, stream channels, and riparian areas to support critical life stages for species and populations dependent on floodplain productivity. Sustainable, long-term benefits to the Kootenai subbasin include reconnecting tributaries to the mainstem Kootenai River, restoring lentic/wetland environments, and improving the natural cycling of carbon and related nutrients.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Kootenai River Ecosystem Restoration Project</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Ecosystem Improvement Project includes nutrient restoration and extensive biomonitoring. This project addresses nutrient losses associated with elimination of large annual flushing flows and losses of floodplain and side channel connectivity. The goal of the project is to recover a productive, healthy and biologically diverse Kootenai River ecosystem with an emphasis on native fish. The Tribe implements the river nutrient addition in collaboration with Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Kootenai River Floodplain Ecosystem Operational Loss Assessment, Protection, Mitigation, and Rehabilitation Project</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Operational Loss Assessment and Mitigation Project has developed a set of tools to assess and monitor abiotic and biotic changes in the ecosystem and the overall condition of the floodplain ecosystem. These tools allow for prioritization, monitoring, and cumulative assessment of potential mitigation projects and enhance our understanding of their contribution to ecosystem restoration.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Albeni Falls Wildlife Mitigation</h4>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of the Albeni Falls Wildlife Mitigation Project is to protect, enhance, and maintain wetland and riparian wildlife habitats as part of ongoing impacts associated with the Albeni Falls hydroelectic project, within the Kootenai Tribe's lands (i.e., Pend Oreille and Kootenai Subbasin). Wildlife impacted by the Albeni Falls Projects include migratory waterfowl, raptor, deer, bear, and moose, which are all significant species to the Kootenai tribal community.
